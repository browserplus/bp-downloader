What is this?

A simple Ruby BrowserPlus service that can Download a file given a URL 
to a temporary page session scoped location, and return a file handle
back to JavaScript.  This is useful to manipulate web based images or
files (like photos with ImageAlter, yeah).

Note that there is a same domain policy, so you can only download
files from the same domain.
